Browser Action (to have some action available all the time)
- if you have something you want accessible regardless of page
- specify an icon, html file
- essentially a mini webpage

Page Action (if you want something to interact with a particular page)
- if you have something that affects individual pages
- no badge, but a button on the side
- can make it show only for certain pages
- only needs to run when those pages are loaded
